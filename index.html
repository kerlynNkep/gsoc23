                                        The Google summer of code program has been one of the greatest experiences of my life.
                                        During the summer I performed a vulnerability assessment and penetration testing engagement on the
                                        Mifos X web application, and the Apache Fineract APIs, to identify vulnerabilities which can be
                                        exploited by malicious hackers and help provide patches for these known vulnerabilities.

                                    <h3>The Project Goals </h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The <b>main goal</b>of this project is to re-assuring the more Enterprise-y type Mifos clients that they can
                                        safely bet on Mifos X as an MFI platform.

                                            <li>Do a detailed Information gathering while setting the scope of the penetration testing
                                                engagement. Perform Inventory and ranking of in scope assets.</li>
                                            <li>Setup Test environment</li>
                                            <li>Carry out Dynamic application security testing usig Owaspzap and Wapiti</li>
                                            <li>Generate and review OWASP Zap report and Waspiti report. At this point, examine the applicationâ€™s security posture.</li>
                                            <li>Eliminate False Positives from ZAP result by manually Pentesting the Mifos X application looking out for OWASP top 10 and
                                                CWE/SANS top 25 security vulnerabilities and the Fineract APIs looking out for OWASP API top 10 vulnerabilities.</li>
                                            <li>Generate 2 reports: An executive summary report and a detailed VAPT report to help developers patch the gaps found in the course of the pentest.</li>
                                            <li>Generate a risk register to analyze and assess findings and its risks to the organization.</li>
                                            <li>Carry out static application security testing using CodeQL</li>
                                            <li>Document SAST process and result</li>
                                            <li>Work with developers to provide patches for known vulnerabilities.</li>
