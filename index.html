                                    <p>
                                        The Google summer of code program has been one of the greatest experiences of my life.
                                        During the summer I performed a vulnerability assessment and penetration testing engagement on the
                                        Mifos X web application, and the Apache Fineract APIs, to identify vulnerabilities which can be
                                        exploited by malicious hackers and help provide patches for these known vulnerabilities.

                                            <dt><b>Planning and Reconnaissance Phase</b></dt>
                                            <dd>The planning phase involves defining the scope of the Pentest and performing asset inventory.
                                                I identified all the organization's assets and ranked the in-scope assets. The we move to the Reconnaissance phase which helps in determining an organization’s information
                                                on the Internet such as network architecture, operating systems, applications, and users. The goal is to gather as much data as possible to enable me plan an effective attack strategy.
                                                <br/>
                                                Reconnaissance can be categorized as either active or passive depending on what methods are used to gather information. Passive reconnaissance pulls information 
                                                from resources that are already publicly available, whereas active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the target system to gain information. Typically, both methods
                                                are necessary to form a full picture of the target’s vulnerabilities.<br/><br/>
                                             </dd>
                                            <dt><b>Scanning phase</b></dt>
                                            <dd>Once all the relevant data has been gathered in the reconnaissance phase, it’s time to move on to scanning. In this phase, 
                                                I made use of various tools to identify open ports and services. Open ports are potential entry points for attackers as such
                                                 penetration testers need to identify as many open ports as possible to be used in the next phase.<br/>

                                                I also carried out vulnerability scanning in this phase and it is an automated process.However, there are 
                                                drawbacks to only performing a scan without a manual penetration test, scanning can identify a potential threat but cannot determine the level at which hackers can gain access. 
                                                So, after the analyzing the results of the vulnerability scanners, it is important to do a manual pentest to eliminate false positives.
                                            </dd><br/>
                                            <dt><b>Exploitation Phase (Gaining Access and Maintaining Access)</b></dt>
                                            <dd>Once vulnerabilities have been identified and we now have an idea of the application’s security posture, it’s time for exploitation. In this phase, I attempted to access the target system and exploit 
                                                the identified vulnerabilities using a couple of techniques.

                                                This phase is the most delicate because accessing the target system requires bypassing security restrictions which may have been put in place. 
                                                The goal of the pentester is to see exactly how far they can get into your environment, identify high-value targets, and avoid any detection.
                                            </dd><br/>
                                            <dt><b>Analysis and Reporting</b></dt>
                                            <dd>
                                                Once the exploitation phase is complete, we then prepare a report documenting the findings gotten during the engagement. The report generated in this 
                                                final penetration testing phase is used to fix any vulnerabilities found in the system and improve the organization’s security posture.<br/>

                                                Building a penetration testing report requires clearly documenting vulnerabilities and putting them into context so that the organization can remediate its security risks. 
                                                Two reports are generated in this phase: the <strong>Detailed VAPT Report </strong> to be used by the developers to fix the vulnerabilites and the <strong>Executive Summary Report</strong> to be 
                                                used by the high stakeholders to access the business impact.<br/><br/>

                                        I would like to sincerely thank my mentors, the Mifos community, and Google for giving me an enriching experience this summer. I am extremely thankful 
                                        for the opportunity to participate in this program and enhance my pentesting skills while implementing this project.<br/>

                                        I am immensely grateful to <b>Godfrey Kutumela</b> for his constant guidance, timely and extensive work reviews, and engagement in regular discussion to clarify my queries.
                                        I have learnt a couple of new skills and new tools and I am grateful for that.<br/>

                                        The Mifos community has always been welcoming and helpful. Their efforts towards improving the developer/user experience have provided a very conducive environment to contribute. 
                                        I am grateful and elated to be a part of it.
